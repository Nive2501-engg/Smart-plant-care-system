A Smart Plant Care System is an intelligent, often IoT-enabled solution designed to monitor and manage the environmental needs of plants automatically. These systems are especially useful for people who want to ensure healthy plant growth without constantly checking on their plants.

🌿 Key Components of a Smart Plant Care System
Sensors
These measure real-time environmental and soil parameters:

Soil moisture sensor – Monitors water content.

Light sensor (LDR) – Measures sunlight intensity.

Temperature and humidity sensor (e.g., DHT11/22) – Tracks ambient conditions.

pH sensor (optional) – For soil acidity/alkalinity.

Microcontroller

Commonly used: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or ESP32/NodeMCU.

Collects data from sensors and controls actuators.

Actuators

Water pump or solenoid valve – Automatically irrigates plants.

LED grow lights – Supplement light if insufficient.

Fan or heater (optional) – Regulates temperature/humidity.

Power Supply

Typically a battery pack, solar panel, or direct power adapter.

Connectivity

Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or LoRa for remote monitoring.

Mobile apps or web dashboards for user interface (UI).

🌱 Common Features
Automatic watering based on soil moisture.

Light adjustment using artificial lights.

Climate control (for enclosed spaces like greenhouses).

Notifications for low water levels, sensor failures, or extreme conditions.

Data logging and visualization (e.g., daily moisture trends).

🛠️ Applications
Home gardening

Smart greenhouses

Agricultural research

Urban farming

Indoor plant maintenance (offices, malls)

🔧 Technologies Used
Hardware: Arduino, ESP8266/ESP32, Raspberry Pi

Sensors: DHT11, Soil Moisture, LDR, pH sensors

Software: C/C++, Python, IoT platforms (e.g., Blynk, ThingSpeak)

Cloud: Firebase, AWS IoT, Google Sheets (for logging)

🧪 Example Use Case
A user sets up a system with a soil moisture sensor and ESP32. If the moisture level falls below a certain threshold, the ESP32 triggers a pump to water the plant and sends an alert to the user's phone via a mobile app.
